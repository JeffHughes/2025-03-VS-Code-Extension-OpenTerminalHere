# Direct Publishing Method

Since the login method is failing, here's a direct way to publish your extension:

## Step 1: Create the Publisher First

1. Go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. Click "New Publisher"
4. Enter "jeff-hughes" as the Publisher ID (must match your package.json)
5. Fill in the other required fields
6. Complete the registration

## Step 2: Create a PAT with Full Access

1. Go to https://dev.azure.com/
2. Click your profile icon â†’ Personal access tokens
3. Click "New Token"
4. Name: "VS Code Full Access"
5. Organization: "All accessible organizations"
6. Expiration: As desired
7. **Important**: For Scopes, select "Full access" instead of custom defined
8. Create and copy the token

## Step 3: Publish Directly

Run this command, replacing TOKEN with your new token:

```bash
npx vsce publish -p TOKEN
```

This bypasses the login step entirely and publishes directly.

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:

1. Verify your Microsoft account is the same between Azure DevOps and Marketplace
2. Check that the publisher ID in package.json matches exactly what you created
3. Try using the web interface to publish at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/
